					<p>Care and precautions while washing your shirt ensure a longer life cycle and a sharp looking shirt each time you wear it. Few things people overlook while washing a shirt are colours, fabric, collars and cuffs. Scrubbing collars and cuffs while washing may cause them to wear out before their lifecycle. To avoid this there are a few things you need to consider while washing your shirts, such as;</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Always unbutton the shirts, including cuffs and collars before washing it.</p></li>
						<li><p>It is okay to wash a shirt at home rather than drycleaning, as long as it does not state otherwise.</p></li>
						<li><p>Never scrub collars or cuff, incase of a stain, presoak the stained area in detergent or use a stain remover pen or brush to get it out. Lemon juice and vinegar are also quite effective in getting stains out.</p></li>
						<li><p>It is better to wash the shirts in gentle cycle of your washing machine.</p></li>
						<li><p>Air-dry your shirt after wash on a hanger rather than spin drying them.</p></li>
						<li><p>Iron the shirt, but wait for it to dry almost completely.</p></li>
					</ul>

				<h2>2. Care for cotton and linens</h2><br><br>
				<p>Commonly in India, we practice wrong washing methods for the garments, causing them to wear out or lose their vibrancy sooner than they should. A little attention while washing the clothes can keep your wardrobe new for a longer time increasing the life cycle of your favorite garments.<br>
				Cotton and linen are natural and delicate fabrics, and hence need extra care and maintenance for a longer life span. The colours on these fabrics need gentle treatment, be it detergents or bleaches. While it is okay to wash whites and light coloured fabrics in warm water, coloured clothes should only be washed in cold water as it does not make the colour bleed. It is also suggested to check if the fabric is a blend of more than one fabric and washing instructions need to be complied accordingly.<br>
				Also note, cotton, being a natural fabric, also has the tendency to shrink while washing. This should be taken into account before shopping and selecting your size.

				<h2>3. Ironing collars and cuffs</h2><br><br>
				<p>Cuffs and collars are the trickiest and most essential parts of a shirt while ironing. They are stiff and hence need extra attention. Also collars and cuffs are usually the first areas to wear out in a shirt. If they are carefully washed and ironed, one can increase the life cycle of the shirt effectively.</p>
				<ul class="col-md-12 col-xs-12">
					<li class="col-md-12 col-xs-12" style="padding-top: 5%;">
						<h3>Collar</h3>
						<div class="img-responsive cover-img col-md-5 col-xs-12" style="background-image: url('<?php echo base_url();?>media/image/blog/Careandinstructions/Ironingcollarsandcuffs/collariron.jpg'); height: 500px;"></div>
						<p class="col-md-7 col-xs-12" style="padding-top: 5%;">Spread out the collar on the ironing board. Start with the outside of the collar that is folded-in. Begin at the outer edge and move inward and not the other way around, this will get rid of the creases that form at the edge of the collar. Once you have got the back flat and wrinkle free, turn the collar as you will wear it and run the iron over the fold. Donâ€™t iron too close to the edges, that leaves a gentle curve in the collars than sharp edges, which look much smarter.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="col-md-12 col-xs-12" style="padding-top: 5%;">
						<h3>Cuffs</h3>
						<p class="col-md-6 col-xs-12" style="padding-top: 5%;">Use the similar technique for the cuffs as for the collars. Spread out the cuff flat on the ironing board and iron the inside of it (the side that touches the skin when you are wearing it). Run the iron from outer edge with an inward motion, while gently pulling the cuff with your hand. For a double cuff (French cuff), after you have got it straight, fold it the way you will be wearing it. Again iron the half, which will be touching the skin, without pressing too hard on the fold, leaving a gently curved cuff rather than a flat folded cuff.</p>
